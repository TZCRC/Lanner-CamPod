# OpenLog Artemis settings

Settings for logging camera pod IMU and GPS data using the Openlog Artemis (OLA) and the ublox ZOE-M8Q GPS unit with QWIIC connection.

To use, copy the two *.txt files to the SD card being used by the OLA, overwriting anything that was there before.

Settings:

* 10Hz logging speed.
* YYYYMMDD date-time format.
* GPS: log heading, ground speed.
* IMU QUAT6 quaternion values recorded.
* Log microseconds
* Log DMP compass
